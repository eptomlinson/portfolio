                            <p>In a time that presents no limit to the uncertainty we face, we must each persevere to continue shaping our destiny. It is no coincidence that my shift in careers coincided with perhaps the greatest public health crisis of our era. Having been laid off at the onset of the Coronavirus lockdown in March of 2020, I saw an opportunity to remake myself into the person I wished to be. I started exercising regularly, started watching what I ate, and most relevant as to why youâ€™re here, I began my journey as a Full Stack Developer. As someone who is creative by nature, there was something appealing about being able to have a hand in creating the very pages I enjoy using; as someone who relishes a challenge, I decided I should go forward with it full steam ahead.</p>
                            
                            <p>Having gone through the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp Full Stack Program, I have experience with numerous coding languages that modern developers use. HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, Mongo, Express, React, Node, and Bootstrap were all put to use in the apps we created for my class assignments. Whether it was boiler plate fitness trackers, employee trackers and duty rosters, or the Game of Games app that looks up board games based on parameters such as name, date of publishing, or minimum or maximum number of players, I used all of these tools to make my apps come to life.</p>

                            <p>Learning a new skill is rewarding in and of itself; mastering a skill, however, is even more rewarding. My education has not stopped now that classes have ended. Using sources like W3Schools and freecodecamp.org, as well as YouTube tutorials and the countless other resources I find, I carry on my education. I continue committing to my repos on GitHub and continue deploying apps purely for the sake of bettering myself as a coder.</p>
                            
                            <p>With my coding skills continuously improving, I am ready to forge ahead and seek out new career opportunities in the world of Full Stack Development. </p>
